# WordleClone
A clone of the popular game "Wordle". Was used to practice basic JavaScript and CSS.
***
## About
<br>
The game was written entirely using vanilla CSS, HTML, and JavaScript. The goal is to guess the 5 letter word in 5 guesses. If you guess a letter that is in the word (but the letter is not in its correct spot) the tile will turn yellow. If you letter is in the correct spot it will turn green. Otherwise the grid will turn grey (just like the actual game).<br>
## Features
<br>
1. If you press enter the submit button will shake. This indicates that you need to click the submit button to make your attempt.<br>
2. Basic alerts to indicate if the user has won or lost (including the amount of guesses and word depending on if the games outcome).<br>
3. Guess is not consumed if the user fails to supply a 5 letter word that is included in my dictionary.<br>
## Note
<br>
The dictionary is quite small right now, so it may be difficult to guess words that are accepted. If you wish to just test the program the correct answer is logged to the console at the start of each game.
